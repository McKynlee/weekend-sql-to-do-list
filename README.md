# Task List

## Description

\*Duration: Approximately 10 hours

This application serves as a To-Do list, that allows the user to: 1. add tasks 1. mark tasks as completed (or if they were marked completed by actually need to be completed still/again, they can be returned to the task list) 1. delete tasks from the list.

Here is a view of a task list that has 6 items already added to it, and 'Exercise' written in the textbox so that it will be added once the user clicks the "Add To List" button:

Here is the view of the task list with 'Exercise' added to the list, and 'Clean the bathroom' has been marked complete by clicking the 'Check off task!' button next to it. At this point, the completed task is displayed with a green background, and can either be returned to its incomplete status by clicking the 'Re-add to task list' button, or be removed from the task list altogether by clicking the 'DELETE' button next to it:
